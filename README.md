# SOAPServer
SOAP-based server with NuSOAP.

## Intro
I tested this project in PHP version 7.2.9.
You can edit service.php as the API interface as you want. I give a sample db_data.sql so you can run this project with [SOAP-Client](https://github.com/alfiankhusnul/SOAPClient). Don't forget to configure database.php according to your DB configuration. I write several comments in Bahasa but its very simple, so I thought you could understand without having to read comments. *cheer
